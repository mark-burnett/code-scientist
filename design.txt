Input file (yaml or dsl) that describes:
 * repo details (or flat files)
 * whether/how to treat a time series from the repo
 * groups of files to treat together
 * what measurements to make
 * what further analysis to do
 * what figures and reports to make
        we *might* be able to just specify the reports or analyses and it could
         figure out the measurement

Overall architecture
 * dependency resolution that can figure out intermediate steps needed to
    calculate measurements/analyses from particular inputs
 * pluggable tools to actually do measurements/analysis
